EDA is the process of analyzing and summarizing datasets to understand their main characteristics, often using visual methods. It involves cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data to identify patterns, detect anomalies, check assumptions, and test hypotheses before applying more advanced statistical techniques or machine learning models.
